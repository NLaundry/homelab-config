Propose a new change - create the change and generate all artifacts in one step.

I'll create a change with artifacts:
- proposal.md (what & why)
- design.md (how)
- tasks.md (implementation steps)

When ready to implement, run /spcb-apply

**Store selection:** If the user names a store (a store is a standalone OpenSpec repo registered on this machine) or the work lives in one, run `openspec store list --json` to discover registered store ids, then pass `--store <id>` on the commands that read or write specs and changes (`new change`, `status`, `instructions`, `list`, `show`, `validate`, `archive`, `doctor`, `context`). Other commands do not take the flag. Hints printed by commands already carry the flag; keep it on follow-ups. Without a store, commands act on the nearest local `openspec/` root.

**Input**: The user's request should include a change name (kebab-case) OR a description of what they want to build.

**Steps**

1. **If no clear input provided, ask what they want to build**

   Use the **AskUserQuestion tool** (open-ended, no preset options) to ask:
   > "What change do you want to work on? Describe what you want to build or fix."

   From their description, derive a kebab-case name (e.g., "add user authentication" → `add-user-auth`).

   **IMPORTANT**: Do NOT proceed without understanding what the user wants to build.

2. **Create the change directory**
   ```bash
   openspec new change "<name>"
   ```
   This creates a scaffolded change in the planning home resolved by the CLI with `.openspec.yaml`.

3. **Get the artifact build order**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>" --json
   ```
   Parse the JSON to get:
   - `applyRequires`: array of artifact IDs needed before implementation (e.g., `["tasks"]`)
   - `artifacts`: list of all artifacts with their status and dependencies
   - `planningHome`, `changeRoot`, `artifactPaths`, and `actionContext`: path and scope context. Use these instead of assuming repo-local paths.

4. **Create artifacts in sequence until apply-ready**

   Use the **TodoWrite tool** to track progress through the artifacts.

   Loop through artifacts in dependency order (artifacts with no pending dependencies first):

   a. **For each artifact that is `ready` (dependencies satisfied)**:
      - Get instructions:
        ```bash
        openspec instructions <artifact-id> --change "<name>" --json
        ```
      - The instructions JSON includes:
        - `context`: Project background (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `rules`: Artifact-specific rules (constraints for you - do NOT include in output)
        - `template`: The structure to use for your output file
        - `instruction`: Schema-specific guidance for this artifact type
        - `resolvedOutputPath`: Resolved path or pattern to write the artifact
        - `dependencies`: Completed artifacts to read for context
      - Read any completed dependency files for context
      - Create the artifact file using `template` as the structure and write it to `resolvedOutputPath`
      - Apply `context` and `rules` as constraints - but do NOT copy them into the file
      - Show brief progress: "Created <artifact-id>"

   b. **Continue until all `applyRequires` artifacts are complete**
      - After creating each artifact, re-run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json`
      - Check if every artifact ID in `applyRequires` has `status: "done"` in the artifacts array
      - Stop when all `applyRequires` artifacts are done

   c. **If an artifact requires user input** (unclear context):
      - Use **AskUserQuestion tool** to clarify
      - Then continue with creation

5. **Show final status**
   ```bash
   openspec status --change "<name>"
   ```

**Output**

After completing all artifacts, summarize:
- Change name and location
- List of artifacts created with brief descriptions
- What's ready: "All artifacts created! Ready for implementation."
- Prompt: "Run `/spcb-apply` or ask me to implement to start working on the tasks."

**Artifact Creation Guidelines**

- Follow the `instruction` field from `openspec instructions` for each artifact type
- The schema defines what each artifact should contain - follow it
- Read dependency artifacts for context before creating new ones
- Use `template` as the structure for your output file - fill in its sections
- **IMPORTANT**: `context` and `rules` are constraints for YOU, not content for the file
  - Do NOT copy `<context>`, `<rules>`, `<project_context>` blocks into the artifact
  - These guide what you write, but should never appear in the output

**Guardrails**
- Create ALL artifacts needed for implementation (as defined by schema's `apply.requires`)
- Always read dependency artifacts before creating a new one
- If context is critically unclear, ask the user - but prefer making reasonable decisions to keep momentum
- If a change with that name already exists, ask if user wants to continue it or create a new one
- Verify each artifact file exists after writing before proceeding to next

## Governed spec model

This project uses the governed spec model (2 permanent truth planes with paired enforcement). Do NOT assume the flat `specs/<capability>/spec.md` layout.

**Confirm the model from the CLI, do not guess:**
- Run `openspec status --change "<name>" --json` and read `specModel`.
- The governed model reports `specModel.kind == "governed"` with
  `planes: [behavior, architecture]` and `pairedEnforcement: true`.
- If `specModel.kind` is `legacy` (or absent), follow the flat-spec guidance
  above unchanged.

**Under the governed model, derive concrete paths from CLI output** (`status`
`artifactPaths` and `openspec instructions <artifact> --change ... --json`),
never hardcode them. Durable truth lives in the declared planes:
- behavior: User/client-visible outcomes (enforcement: tests / property tests) → `specs/behavior/<locator>/{spec.md,enforcement.md}`
- architecture: Package responsibilities, boundaries, and structural invariants (enforcement: lint / static-analysis / conformance) → `specs/architecture/<locator>/{spec.md,enforcement.md}`

Every governed `spec.md` is PAIRED with an `enforcement.md`. Stable identity is
scoped narrowly: the frontmatter `id` (e.g. `behavior.<locator>`) is the only project-unique governed ID; requirement, scenario, and binding `**ID:**` slugs are unique only within their pair, and stay fixed when titles or locators move.

**Plane classification:** match each proposed claim to the plane whose declared
purpose best fits the claim's nature. The shipped defaults are behavior, architecture; a single initiative may touch several planes — list one spec per plane touched, never mix planes in one spec.

**Structure conventions (governed):**
- Locators may nest to arbitrary safe depth (e.g. `behavior/platforms/desktop`);
  JSON reports normalized slash-separated locators, filesystem access is native.
- A directory that only GROUPS child pairs is a **namespace** and needs no pair of
  its own. Only a directory that contains `spec.md` must also contain
  `enforcement.md`; ancestry provides navigation, never inherited requirements.
- A change stores its `spec.md` and `enforcement.md` deltas under the SAME
  plane-qualified locator as the target current pair, so both members move together.

### Classifying planes and creating pairs (governed)

- **Classify every proposed spec by plane** (behavioral vs architectural truth).
  A single initiative may change user-visible behavior AND package boundaries; if
  so, author **separate deltas for each plane**, each with its own stable spec ID.
- **Create specifications THEN enforcement**, following the schema's artifact
  order (`specs` before `enforcement`). Get each artifact's guidance and output
  path from `openspec instructions <artifact> --change "<name>" --json` and write
  to the CLI-reported paths.
- **Assign stable identity when authoring:** a project-unique spec `id` in the
  `spec.md` frontmatter, and pair-local `**ID:**` slugs for each requirement,
  scenario, and enforcement binding.
- **Pair every governed spec with enforcement:** each SHALL/MUST requirement needs
  at least one binding in the paired `enforcement.md`; a binding may be
  `planned` while planning but must become `active` before verify/archive. A
  `covers` list references only IDs from its own pair.
- **Author bindings by the philosophy below - now the requirements exist, apply
  it concretely:** for each requirement choose the *highest-leverage real check*
  and name concrete `targets`; bind at the requirement level; and use honest
  `review`/`manual` bindings where no automated check is meaningful. Do NOT
  emit one binding per scenario or a hollow test to inflate coverage. "At least
  one binding" is a floor for honest evidence, not a quota to maximize.

### Enforcement philosophy (governed)

Enforcement records how each normative claim is *known to hold* - it is not a
coverage quota. Aim for deliberate, honest evidence, not a wall of tests:

- **Coverage is a mirror, not a target.** A passing check proves it *ran*, not
  that it verifies the claim; do not maximize automated bindings for their own
  sake. `degraded` (a spec covered only by review/manual) is factual, not a
  demerit - never write a hollow test to "upgrade" it.
- **Prefer the highest-leverage check.** ONE fitness function (lint /
  static-analysis / conformance test) protects a structural invariant across the
  whole codebase; ONE property/invariant test covers a whole family of cases.
  Reach for these before example tests.
- **Bind at the requirement level, not per scenario.** Scenarios are examples
  that one binding's test family already covers - do NOT write one test per
  scenario, and do NOT create one binding per scenario.
- **Spend example tests on what bites:** the representative, edge, and risky
  cases - not every enumerated path.
- **Match mechanism to plane:** architectural invariants -> lint /
  static-analysis / conformance; behavioral claims -> tests / property tests;
  subjective or UX claims -> an honest `review` binding with a real procedure;
  genuinely unverifiable-today -> a `manual` binding stating its `limitations`.
  Use review/manual openly and first-class rather than faking automation.
